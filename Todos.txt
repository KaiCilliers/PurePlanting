- be able to run all tests with a single command
- common android and kotlin gradle files
    - clean up gradle files and only use dependencies that are required by module
- fix logic for workers
    - prevent a notification every 15min for the same plant, i.e. plants with time between two times OR have a flag somewhere that a notification has already been created for this plant today
    - schedule a daily forgot to water worker
- logic to prevent user from navigating away from Add/Edit screen when they have made changes (well, prompt them with confirmation dialog)
- snackbar emitter to solve scenario where plant is created and system navs back to home ( i want to show snackbar there on home)
    - if this is the best solution (i.e. a global event emitter to show on activity, since we will ONLY have one activity, this makes sense)
    - I want to use material 3 snackbar though, so i need to be able to create composable snackbar
- system notification deeplink to plant detail or home
- remove hardcoded DP values
- live template to create UI compose components with preview (private)
- animations for dialog appearance
- correct navigation animation (replace or back, or front)
- plant watering amount is String, replace with something else (value class)
- worker to clear temp files
- see if you can fix lost captured image when app is destroyed when camera is launched
- see wtf data_extraction_rules.xml is used for
